- **Activities:**
  - Watch relevant videos from the selected playlist(s).
  - Take detailed notes on each topic.
  - Create summary sheets for quick revision.

## Week 2: Data Link Layer - Part 1

- **Topics:** Logical Link Control (LLC) sub-layer: Framing, Data Communication Character Codes, Error Control: Error Detection (Redundancy Checking: VRC, Checksum, LRC, CRC); Retransmission, Error Correction: Forward Error Correction (Hamming Code), Character Synchronization, Reliable transmission and Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocols including Stop-and-Wait, Go-back-N, Selective Repeat; Performance analysis of ARQ protocols; Example protocols such as HDLC and PPP.
- **Activities:**
  - Watch lectures covering these topics.
  - Practice error detection and correction techniques.
  - Summarize ARQ protocols and their performance analyses.

## Week 3: Data Link Layer - Part 2

- **Activities:**
  - Delve into IP addressing and subnetting exercises.
  - Study routing algorithms and protocols.
  - Familiarize yourself with tools like Wireshark.

## Week 5: Transport Layer

- **Topics:** Introduction and Transport-Layer Services, Port Address, Socket Address; Internet Transport Protocols: UDP, Introduction to UDP, Remote Procedure call, Real-time Transport Protocols; Internet Transport Protocols: TCP, service model, TCP protocol, TCP segment header, TCP Connection establishment, TCP Connection Release, TCP Connection management modeling, TCP sliding window, TCP Timer management, TCP Congestion control; Performance Issues: Performance problems in computer networks, Network Performance Management, Host Design for fast networks; Fast segment processing, Header compression, protocols for long Fat networks; Virtual Private Network (VPN); Introduction of Nmap Tool.
- **Activities:**
  - Understand the differences between UDP and TCP.
  - Study TCP connection management and congestion control.
  - Explore VPNs and tools like Nmap.

## Week 6: Revision and Practice

- **Activities:**
  - Review all notes and summary sheets.
  - Solve past exam papers and sample questions.
  - Clarify any remaining doubts by revisiting specific lectures.

**General Tips:**

- **Daily Commitment:** Allocate 2-3 hours daily for watching lectures and making notes.
- **Active Learning:** Engage in discussions with peers or online forums to deepen understanding.
- **Practical Application:** If possible, set up a small network environment to practice concepts like subnetting, routing, and using tools like Wireshark and Nmap.
