## 📘 **Unit I: Introduction to Research Problem (9 Lecture Hours)**

---
### 🔹 1. **Understanding Research Problem: Meaning and Significance**

#### ✅ Meaning:

- A **research problem** is a **specific issue, difficulty, or knowledge gap** that you aim to address through systematic study.
    
- It's the **starting point** of any research.
    

#### ✅ Significance:

- Guides your **entire research direction**.
    
- Helps avoid **vagueness or aimlessness**.
    
- Ensures you're solving something **useful and relevant**.
    

#### 📌 Example:

- “How can machine learning improve the accuracy of medical diagnoses?”
    
- This is **specific, practical, and important**.
    

---

### 🔹 2. **Sources and Identification of Research Problem**

#### ✅ Sources:

- **Personal Experience**: e.g., noticing inefficiencies in a software you use.
    
- **Literature Review**: Finding gaps in existing studies.
    
- **Industry Problems**: E.g., low battery life in smartphones.
    
- **Government/NGO Reports**: Unemployment trends.
    
- **Conferences, Journals, and Experts**.
    

#### ✅ Identification:

- Read extensively.
    
- Talk to domain experts.
    
- Observe real-world problems.
    

#### 📌 Example:

- A CS student reads a research paper and sees “energy consumption in edge devices” is rarely studied → chooses that as a research area.

### 🔹 3. **Criteria and Characteristics of a Good Research Problem**

#### ✅ Essential Attributes:

- **Clear & Unambiguous**
    
- **Feasible** (in terms of time, resources)
    
- **Novelty** (not already solved)
    
- **Relevant** to field/society
    
- **Ethical** (no harm to people/environment)
    
- **Objective-Driven**
    

#### ✅ Common Errors in Selection:

- Too broad or too narrow.
    
- Not enough resources or time to complete.
    
- Already well-researched (nothing new to add).
    
- Biased or emotionally driven.
    
- Based on **assumptions**, not evidence.
    

#### 📌 Example:

- ✅ Good: “What techniques improve compression in real-time video streaming on low-bandwidth networks?”
    
- ❌ Bad: “How do humans think?” (Too vague!)
    

---

### 🔹 4. **Scope and Objectives of Research Problem**

#### ✅ Scope:

- Defines the **boundaries**: What _will_ and _won’t_ be covered.
    
- Prevents the project from becoming **too large or directionless**.
    

#### ✅ Objectives:

- Clear **goals or outcomes** the researcher wants to achieve.
    
- Should follow the SMART principle:
    
    - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
        

#### 📌 Example:

- **Scope**: Study only Android devices, not iOS.
    
- **Objective**: “To develop and test a low-power ML model for detecting fall-risk in elderly users.”

### 🔹 5. **Approaches for Solution**

#### ✅ Investigative Approaches:

- **Theoretical**: Mathematical proofs, logical reasoning.
    
- **Experimental**: Lab experiments, simulations.
    
- **Survey-Based**: Questionnaires, feedback.
    
- **Case Study**: In-depth study of a single instance.
    

#### ✅ 📌 Example:

- Studying online learning efficiency:
    
    - Theoretical: Model of attention span decay.
        
    - Survey: Ask students about fatigue.
        
    - Experimental: Test quiz scores over time.
        

---

### 🔹 6. **Data Collection, Analysis, Interpretation**

#### ✅ Data Collection:

- **Primary**: Surveys, experiments, interviews.
    
- **Secondary**: Existing datasets, papers, reports.
    

#### ✅ Data Analysis:

- Use **statistical tools** (e.g., Python Pandas, R, Excel).
    
- **Qualitative or Quantitative** depending on data type.
    

#### ✅ Interpretation:

- Draw **meaningful conclusions**.
    
- Relate findings to objectives.
    
- Avoid **bias or overgeneralization**.
    

#### 📌 Example:

- You gather 100 student feedback forms, use Python to analyze satisfaction trends, and conclude: _“Video lectures > long PDFs”_.
    

---

### 🔹 7. **Necessary Instrumentation**

#### ✅ What it Means:

- Tools, software, and instruments needed to conduct the research.
    

#### ✅ Examples:

- **Software**: Python, MATLAB, SPSS, Jupyter, TensorFlow.
    
- **Hardware**: Sensors, IoT kits, GPUs.
    
- **Instruments**: Online survey tools like Google Forms or Qualtrics.
    

#### 📌 Example:

- For a project on facial emotion detection:
    
    - Use OpenCV (software)
        
    - Webcam (hardware)
        
    - Scikit-learn (analysis tool)
