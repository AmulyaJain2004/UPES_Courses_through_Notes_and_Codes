## 🧠 UNIT II: RESEARCH METHODS IN COMPUTING SCIENCE (13 HOURS)

---

### 🔁 1. **Dialectic of Research in Computing Science**

**What is Dialectic?**

- Dialectic is the **art of argumentation** or structured discussion.
    
- In research, it helps frame problems, justify solutions, and defend positions logically.
    

**Three Models of Argument:**

1. **Demonstration-Based (Logical Proofs):**
    
    - Uses **logic or mathematics** to prove correctness.
        
    - 🔸 _Example_: Proving correctness of an algorithm using induction.
        
    - **Used in**: Theoretical CS, algorithms, complexity.
        
2. **Empirical-Based (Experiments & Observation):**
    
    - Relies on **data collection and experiments**.
        
    - 🔸 _Example_: Testing the performance of sorting algorithms with datasets.
        
    - **Used in**: Software performance analysis, ML model evaluation.
        
3. **Mathematical-Based:**
    
    - Involves **mathematical models or equations** to represent systems.
        
    - 🔸 _Example_: Queuing theory used to model network traffic.
        

✅ **Why It Matters**: Helps choose appropriate method for validating your research.

🧠 **Mnemonic**:  
**"Demo dekh, data le, math lagaa — research ka full jugaaad!"**  
(Use Demonstration, Data, and Math — that’s how research ka kaam is done!)

### 🔍 2. **Deduction and Induction in Computer Science**

#### 🔸 A. Deduction (Top-Down Approach)

- **Starts with theory** → deduces outcomes.
    
- Applies general principles to reach specific conclusions.
    
- 🔸 _Example_:
    
    - You know “All trees in a binary search tree (BST) follow order” → You deduce that “Node A must be greater than Node B in this case.”
        
- **Used in**: Algorithm design, formal methods.
    

#### 🔸 B. Induction (Bottom-Up Approach)

- **Starts with observations/data** → builds theory.
    
- Uses real-world patterns to generalize.
    
- 🔸 _Example_:
    
    - Observing students who study at night score higher → hypothesize “Night owls do better academically.”
        
- **Used in**: Machine Learning, Data Mining.
    

🧠 **Mnemonic**:  
**"Deduct karo theory se — Induce karo reality se!"**  
(Deduction from theory, Induction from reality — easy, breezy research ki clarity!)

### 📐 3. **Theoretical Models and Approaches**

- Used to **abstractly represent systems**, understand their properties.
    
- Often **idealized** or simplified for analysis.
    

🔸 _Examples_:

- **Finite Automata**: Used in compilers and language design.
    
- **Turing Machines**: Fundamental for algorithmic limits.
    
- **Graphs**: Representing networks, paths, trees.
    

🧠 **Why Important?**

- Helps you **reason about systems** without actually building them.
    

🧠 **Mnemonic**:  
**“Theory ke model — practical ka chhota bhai!”**  
(Theory models are the baby version of real-world systems — cute but clever!)

---

### 💻 4. **Algorithmic and Software Engineering Approaches**

#### 🔸 A. Algorithmic Approach

- Involves **designing, analyzing, and optimizing algorithms**.
    
- 🔸 _Example_: Time/space complexity of QuickSort.
    

#### 🔸 B. Software Engineering Approach

- Focuses on **structured development**, testing, and maintenance.
    
- 🔸 _Example_: Agile development, version control, testing frameworks.
    

🧠 **Mnemonic**:  
**“Algo se speed, SE se need!”**  
(Algorithms give speed, Software Engineering gives user-needs fulfillment!)

---

### 📊 5. **Mathematical Modelling**

- Uses **mathematics to represent real systems**.
    
- Allows simulation, prediction, and control.
    

🔸 _Examples_:

- **Linear Regression**: Model the relationship between study hours and GPA.
    
- **Graph Theory**: Optimize routing in networks.
    

🧠 **Used In**:

- Simulation, ML, network modeling.
    

🧠 **Mnemonic**:  
**“Math ka model, duniya ka throttle!”**  
(Mathematical models control and drive real-world systems!)

---

### 🏁 6. **Performance Estimation and Evaluation**

- Measures **efficiency and effectiveness** of algorithms/systems.
    

#### Key Metrics:

- **Time complexity**
    
- **Space complexity**
    
- **Accuracy, Precision (for ML)**
    
- **CPU usage, memory (for systems)**
    

🔸 _Example_:  
Evaluating 3 sorting algorithms on datasets of size 1K, 10K, and 100K.

🧠 **Mnemonic**:  
**“Performance check kar lo bhai, warna code fail ho jaayega bhai!”**  
(Check performance, or your code will crash like a broken chai cup!)
